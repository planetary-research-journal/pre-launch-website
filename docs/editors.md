# Editors

We are seeking approximately five editors who will oversee the peer review of manuscripts that are submitted to the journal. Editors are responsible for the decision to publish a manuscript or not, and the workload is expected to be about two new manuscripts per month (which can be adjusted to suit the time constraints of each editor). Editors can make use of associate editors for various aspects of the peer review process.

Interested candidates should provide a CV, a publication list, and a short letter motivating their interest in the position to the [chair of the search committee](mailto:mark.wieczorek@cnrs.fr) before July 1, 2025.

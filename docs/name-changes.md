# Name changes

Planetary Research recognizes that an author may change their name for a variety of reasons. The journal does not ask for any justification or proof of the name change, and the journal asks only that the name change be consistent with the name on the author's [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) profile. Name change requests require the explicit consent of the author whose name is being changed.

When asked to change an author's name, the journal will update the name used in all of the author's previous publications with the journal. The name associated with the online HTML version of the article will be updated, and when technically possible, the journal will regenerate a new PDF version of the article with the new name. The DOIs of the affected articles will not be changed, but the article metadata will be updated to reflect the name change both on the journal's website and in any databases where the journal uploads article metadata.

Recognizing that a name change is a personal matter, the author will be given the choice to update the publication record silently, or to publish a formal erratum that notes the change to the manuscript. When the author chooses to update their name silently with no erratum, the journal recommends the author to inform all co-authors of the affected manuscripts of the change. When publishing an erratum, the author may choose to keep the prior name on the manuscript and to simply note the author's new name.

The journal will not change any citations in articles published by the journal following a name change request. The journal is also not in a position to ask third parties to update the author's name, nor to replace any archived versions of the affected manuscript with the corrected version.

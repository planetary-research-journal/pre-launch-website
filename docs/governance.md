# Governance

The journal is governed by XXXX, which is a non-profit association registered in France whose mission is to support the dissemination of scientific research in the field of planetary science. The steering committee of the association is responsible for overseeing all non-editorial functions of the journal, and is responsible for appointing the editor-in-chief and editors of the journal's editorial board. The editorial board retains complete editorial independence from the association's steering committee.

## Steering committee roles

The steering committee is in charge of overseeing all non-editorial functions of the journal, enforcing the journal's non-editorial policies, creating subcommittees when needed, and facilitating the flow of information among the editorial board and subcommittees. The steering committee is composed of five members elected by the association members, the editor-in-chief, and the heads of any subcommittees. After each election, the steering committee will designate a Chair who is responsible for setting the committee's agenda, organizing timely meetings, and holding an annual general assembly that is open to the public. The Chair has the right to appoint one additional steering committee member, if desired. The steering committee will also designate a Treasurer who is responsible for overseeing all financial aspects of the association and journal.

The steering committee appoints the editor-in-chief, which will be done in consultation with an editor search committee. The editor search committee will announce the open position to the community and will encourage suitable candidates to apply. Once selected, the editor-in-chief and the editor search committee will be responsible for nominating additional editors for the editorial board, who will then be presented to the steering committee for approval. All positions on the editorial board are for a term of five years.

The steering committee has the authority to create subcommittees when they are necessary. A public announcement will first be made seeking candidates for the subcommittee as well as candidates to lead the subcommittee. Once the subcommittee head is selected, they will be responsible for nominating additional subcommittee members who will be presented to the steering committee for approval. All subcommittee positions are for a term of five years.

All members of the journal are invited to attend the steering committee meetings. Journal members include all members of the steering committee, the editorial board, and any other subcommittees created by the steering committee. Non-steering committee members, however, will have no voting rights, and may be asked to leave when considering confidential matters.

## Elections

When one or more steering committee positions are open, the Chair of the steering committee will organize an election. Anyone who is a member of the association, which includes all persons with an account on the journal website, may nominate themself for an open position, and any member of the association may vote. All elected positions are for a term of five years.

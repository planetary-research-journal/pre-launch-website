# Governance

The journal is owned by the Planetary Research Cooperative, which is a non-profit association registered in France whose mission is to support the dissemination of scientific research in the field of planetary science. The steering committee of the association is responsible for overseeing all non-editorial functions of the journal, and is responsible for appointing the editor-in-chief and editors of the journal's editorial board. The editorial board retains complete editorial independence from the association's steering committee.

## Steering committee roles

The steering committee is in charge of overseeing all non-editorial functions of the journal, enforcing the journal's non-editorial policies, creating subcommittees when needed, and facilitating the flow of information among the editorial board and subcommittees. The steering committee is composed of six members elected by the association members, the editor-in-chief, and the heads of any subcommittees. Half of the board is elected every two years, and after each election the steering committee will designate a Chair, Treasurer, and Secretary. The chair is responsible for setting the committee's agenda, organizing timely meetings, and holding an annual general assembly that is open to the public. The Chair has the right to appoint one additional steering committee member, if desired. The treasurer is responsible for overseeing all financial aspects of the association and journal, and the secretary is responsible for all internal data archiving.

The steering committee appoints the editor-in-chief, which will be done in consultation with an editor search committee. The editor search committee will announce the open position to the community and will encourage suitable candidates to apply. Once selected, the editor-in-chief and the editor search committee will be responsible for nominating additional editors for the editorial board, who will then be presented to the steering committee for approval. All positions on the editorial board are for a term of four years.

The steering committee has the authority to create subcommittees when they are necessary. A public announcement will first be made seeking candidates for the subcommittee. Once the subcommittee head is selected, they will be responsible for nominating additional subcommittee members who will be presented to the steering committee for approval. All subcommittee positions are for a term of four years.

All members of the journal are invited to attend the steering committee meetings. Journal members include all members of the steering committee, the editorial board, and any other subcommittees created by the steering committee. Non-steering committee members, however, will have no voting rights, and may be asked to leave when considering confidential matters.

## Elections

An election will occur every two years to replace the three outgoing steering committee members. Anyone who is a member of the association, which includes anyone with an account on the association website, may nominate themself for an open position, and any member of the association may vote. All elected positions are for a term of four years.
